# OpenCL wrapper libraries for Go

This repository is the central entry point for [OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/) wrapper libraries for [Go](https://go.dev).
It serves as the central information source, issue tracker, and discussion space.

## Motivation

The goal of this project is to maintain OpenCL wrapper libraries that

* Provide the full functionality of main OpenCL API
* Provide documentation to help in the usage of the API
* Handle the most low-level properties of the API to expose a more Go-idiomatic approach
* Allow extensibility via OpenCL extensions
* Are also available for newer API versions (OpenCL 2.2, 3.0)
